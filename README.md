This repository contains various projects focused on designing and implementing home network setups using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each project demonstrates different aspects of network configuration, security, and management within a home environment.

**Project1**
This project is an intermediate-level home network setup using Cisco Packet Tracer, designed to provide a realistic simulation of a small, modern home network. The network includes both wired and wireless components, and is segmented into multiple subnets for better organization and security. The primary goal is to create a functional and secure home network that supports various devices, including PCs, laptops, smartphones, IoT devices, and a dedicated server.
